# PIC10C-HW2

PIC10C-HW2 is a final grade calculator implemented using Qt Creator. It computes the grade of a student given a set of homework and exam scores. 

More detailed instructions can be found here: <https://www.pic.ucla.edu/~rsalazar/spring2020/assignments/hw2/>

I didn't figure out how to calculate grades from different classes, but I made my "Calculate Grade" button official UCLA colors... so maybe that'll get me a point in the extras category :) Go Bruins!
